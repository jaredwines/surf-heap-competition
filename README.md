# Surf Heap Competition

Surf Heap Competition is a schedule generator that gives the most appropriate match up for each competitor.

## How it works

Surf Heap Competition uses a heap data structure in order to calculate the ideal competitor for each surfer. The calculation is done by finding the surfers closest match in points. If the number of competitors is even then the surfer with the most points is matched with the surfer with the least amount of points. If the number of competitors is old then the surfer with the most points receives a bi. The surfers are upload via txt file and the results of the generator schedule is displayed via txt file.

## Usage

The proper format for the txt file is as follows.

```
Surfer1
100
Surfer2
150
Surfer3
125
Surfer4
75
```
